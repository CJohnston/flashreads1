                    From Publishers Weekly,
                    This magnificent eighth novel (after 2000's Look to Windward) of the Culture, an interstellar
                    posthuman civilization of incredible wealth and technological sophistication, centers on three
                    siblings: Ferbin and Oramen, the misfit heirs of conquering King Hausk of the Sarl, who rules
                    a backward and patriarchal realm deep beneath the surface of the artificial Shellworld Sursamen,
                    and their exiled sister, Djan, now a powerful agent of the Culture's Special Circumstances division.
                    When King Hausk is murdered, Ferbin narrowly avoids the conspirators and sets out across the galaxy
                    to ask Djan's help with revenge against the killer, now serving as Oramen's regent. Soon they
                    learn of the horrific forces a hidden enemy is about to unleash on Sursamen, and must race to save
                    the home that has rejected them both

Debut author Bradford comes out swinging in this fast-paced adventure set in medieval Japan, the first in the projected
Young Samurai trilogy. Twelve-year-old Jack Fletcher has gained a reputation aboard a British merchant vessel as an agile
 rigging monkey. But after Japanese ninja murder the entire crew, including his father, Jack is left alone and injured to
 cope with strange customs and indecipherable language. When he shows his fortitude and cleverness, however, a powerful
samurai adopts him and sends him to learn the ways of Japan's warrior class. Jack's story alone makes for a page-turner,
but coupling it with intriguing bits of Japanese history and culture, Bradford produces an adventure novel to rank among
the genre's best. The intricate and authentic descriptions of martial arts contests will hold readers spellbound. Just
as potent for many readers, though, are the outright hatred and prejudice Jack faces as a gaijin, or foreigner, while he
attempts to master an elaborate code of honor. This book earns the literary equivalent of a black belt. Ages 10 up. (Mar.)

lively and exciting fight sequences and is slowly beginning to develop a keen edge to his cast of characters, laying
significant groundwork for future installments. Grades 6-9. --Ian Chipman</p>},
